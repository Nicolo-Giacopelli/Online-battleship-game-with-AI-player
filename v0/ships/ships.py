    The Ship is conceived as a attribute of the class Player in a precise number depending on the size (and the number
    of lives) of the Ship, for a total number of 10 ships per player.

    Parameters
    ----------
    start_idx: list
        2-member list comprising the row and column indexes of the matrix entry where the ship start from.
    end_idx: list
        2-member list comprising the row and column indexes of the matrix entry where the ship end to.

    Attributes
    ----------
    start_row: int
        the row index of the matrix entry where the ship starts from, i.e. start_idx[0]
    start_col: int
        the row index of the matrix entry where the ship starts from, i.e. start_idx[1]
    end_row: int
        the row index of the matrix entry where the Ship ends to, i.e. end_idx[0]
    end_col: int
        the col index of the matrix entry where the Ship ends to, i.e. end_idx[1]
    dead: bool
        a value set to False until the remaining lives of the instance of Ship arrive to 0
    list_coordinates: list
        a list of lists comprising all the pairs row-col indexes of each square of the board
        onto which the Ship is placed
    shadow: list
        a list of lists comprising all the pairs row-col indexes lying along any placed ship
        (i.e. along the borders)
    vertical: bool
        a boolen standing for whether the Ship is horizontal or vertical
    size: int
        an attribute storing the length of the Ship
    life: int
        an attribute storing the number of lives available to each Ship, which is at first set equal
        to the size and then automatically updated whenever the Ship is hit
    name: str
        the attribute storing the name of the Ship, used to uniquely identify the type of the Ship
        and automatically generated whenever a Ship is placed
