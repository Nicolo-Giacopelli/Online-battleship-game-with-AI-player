    Parameters
    ----------
    ship_size: int
        attribute variable representing the length of the Ship (with board squares as unit of measure)

    Attributes
    ----------
    image: pygame.Surface
        definition of the image attribute of the pygame.sprite object, which will be a surface object

    rect: pygame object
        rectangular coordinates of the ship object
    dead: bool
        a value set to False until the remaining lives of the instance of Ship arrive to 0
    size: int
        an attribute storing the length of the Ship
    life: int
        an attribute storing the number of lives available to each Ship, which is at first set equal
        to the size and then automatically updated whenever the Ship is hit
    name: str
        the attribute storing the name of the Ship, used to uniquely identify the type of the Ship
        and automatically generated whenever a Ship is placed
